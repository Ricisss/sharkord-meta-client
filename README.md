  <h1>Sharkord Meta Client</h1>
  <p><strong>An opinionated open-source meta-client for Sharkord, designed to provide a unified, Discord-like experience for users connecting to multiple Sharkord servers simultaneously.</strong></p>
</div>


## The Vision

[Sharkord](https://github.com/Sharkord/sharkord) is an incredible open-source alternative for community communication. However, jumping between browser tabs in order to communicate on multiple servers can be cumbersome. **Sharkord Meta Client** aims to solve this by providing a single desktop application that manages all your Sharkord instances in one place.

> **Note:** This project is a *Meta Client*. It does not aim to add or change features within Sharkord itself. Instead, it focuses on the **orchestration and experience** of using multiple servers at the same time.


## Key Features

- **Multi-Server Management**: Add and switch between multiple Sharkord servers seamlessly via a dedicated sidebar.
- **Real-time Status & Notifications**: Integrated tRPC/WebSocket support provides unread message badges and server online/offline status at a glance.
- **Client-side Enhancements**: Automatic JavaScript injection to autologin to your Sharkord servers.
